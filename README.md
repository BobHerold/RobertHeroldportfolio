This site will be an ongoing dynamic page, designed to furnish information on my coding skills and career journey.

Initial creation is for my first milestone project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute (https://codeinstitute.net/), 
with the goal of presenting information to potential employers/recruiters who will be able to assess my qualifications quickly and efficiently.

## UX

 The purpose of the site is to provide a simple, easy to use format presenting information about myself.

 #### User Stories

 "As a recruiter, I want to quickly and easily find all relevant information on the potential client".

 "As an employer, my need to find past working experience is important to me."

 "On our Human Resources team, we look for the information that pertains to the specific needs of the company, and does this individual have those skills sets."

 ## Features

### Existing Features

  * __Home page__ - a picture and brief introduction to myself.

  * __Skills__ -allows the user to see my current coding skill set. When a user clicks on any one of the logos on this page, it is hypelinked to a wikipedia info page about that skill.

  * __Experience__  -my career journey presented in a timeline fashion. Clicking on any of the corporate entities listed here, will immediately open up a seperate page linked to their corporate web site.

  * __Resume__  -the latest edition of my resume.  This resume needs to be updated at the time of this writing to reflect my current/ongoing coding skill set and education.

  * __Contact__  -an e-mail form to send a request for contact to me.  This form responds to input and sends an e-mail directly to my e-mail inbox at Yahoo.


  ###  Features Left to Implement

  * __Projects__ - a page to showcase completed coding projects created by myself.

 ## Testing

 1.  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/  has been used to see how the site performs on different Apple devices and their viewports, all pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the AppleDevicesView.png at the top of this Readme.

 2.  I have viewed this site in 3 different browsers from my desktop; Chrome, Internet Edge and  Mozilla Firefox.  All pages, links on those pages, and footer icon links perform well on all viewport sizes, using Chrome Developer Tool's, Device Toolbar for testing.  I've also used my own iPhone6 w/Safari and Chrome browsers for testing the site, as well as relatives testing the site on their Android smartphones.  All features and links work as expected.

 3.  BUGS:  The most obvious bugs I have seen in testing is shown below circled in red. On Viewports starting at 765 x 850, on the Experience page, the Timeline seems to have a 2nd connecting white line connecting the companie's content elements, as well as a slightly different colored arrow (not all) pointing to the main timeline, and the circular dot on the timeline is lightly cut off on the left side of the circle.
  Due to time constraints on getting this project submitted I'm unable to address them right now.
