# Robert Herold Portfolio

This site will be an ongoing dynamic page, designed to furnish information on my experiences and coding journey.

Initial creation is for my first milestone project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute, 
with the goal of presenting my information so that potential employers/recruiters will be able to better assess my capabilities.
