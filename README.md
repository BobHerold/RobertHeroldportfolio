This site will be an ongoing dynamic page, designed to furnish information on my career experiences and coding journey.

Initial creation is for my first milestone project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute, 
with the goal of presenting information so that potential employers/recruiters will be able to assess my qualifications quickly and efficiently.

## UX

 The purpose of the site is to provide a simple, easy to use format presenting information about myself.

 #### User Stories

 "As a recruiter, I want to quickly and easily find all relevant information on the potential client".

 "As an employer, my need to find past working experience is important to me."

 "On our Human Resources team, we look for the information that pertains to the specific needs of the company, and does this individual have that skill set."
