This site will be an ongoing dynamic page, designed to furnish information on my career experiences and coding journey.

Initial creation is for my first milestone project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute, 
with the goal of presenting information so that potential employers/recruiters will be able to assess my qualifications quickly and efficiently.

## UX

 The purpose of the site is to provide a simple, easy to use format presenting information about myself.

 #### User Stories

 "As a recruiter, I want to quickly and easily find all relevant information on the potential client".
